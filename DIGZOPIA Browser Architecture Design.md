   - Price and value tracking

### Integration Approach

1. **Native Integration Model**
   - Wallet functionality built directly into browser (like Brave)
   - Shared security context with browser core
   - Direct UI integration rather than extension-based approach

2. **Secure Communication**
   - Isolated context for key operations
   - Secure messaging between browser and wallet components
   - Permission-based access for dApps and websites

3. **Web3 Provider Implementation**
   - Standard Web3 provider interface for website compatibility
